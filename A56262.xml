            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The Authours of theſe Letters are Very well known to moſt of our Ancient clergy men, yet becauſe they may fall into ſome hands who may be ſtrangers to them I will here giue a ſhort Character of them.</p>

            <p>His next work was to ſtrengthen himſelf in the Chapter, by introducing into it his diſciples, who out of reſpect to their maſter, and Gratitude to their benefactors would ſtand to him, which ſucceeded euen beyond his own expectation for in a ſhort time by the death of the ancient orthodox men, and numbers of other new ones, he became ſo powerfull in it, that nether the oppoſition of the Biſhop, and his officers nor the cenſures of <hi>Doway</hi> firſt, and <hi>Rome</hi> afterward of his writings nor the diſlike of the Catholicks nor the dreadfull death of ſeuerall of his A bettors without the Sacraments, a viſible hand of God appearing againſt them, as Dr <hi>Leybourn</hi> truly ſayd were able to put a ſtop to the Progres of his noueltys.</p>
            <p>His temper was a deep melancholy which he encreaſed by his Continuall ſtudyes.

            <p>THough I had nothing from you this weeke, but a notaries Act, yet I muſt write vnto you. The occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is a word you writ to ſir Ken. that F. Hardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quan thanked you and that monſr Bernardiere was the cauſe. The which I wonder you ſhould write: for the effect being againſt the Queens intention, that is our ſtate for the preſent, you cannot haue deſerued thanks if you haue done according to her intention. The which neuertheles I ſuppoſe you haue done, both becauſe you haue taken the truſt vppon you, and becauſe you are none of thoſe, who think that priuate men vnder pretence of Religion may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of Kingdomes, the which they doe who think that Ireland muſt be put in its own hands, and our King to rely upon their faiths. For the Pope, or ſtrangers to order things ſo I eaſily conceaue it no inconuenience: But for an Engliſh man. I know not how he can do it with mantaining his duty to his country, that is, to God. God hath ſet diuers degrees in our country, and haueing giuen the charge of gouerning to ſome <hi>eo ipſo</hi> hath taken it from the reſt who are to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote their Religion all they can, vnder and not oppoſitely to the ſteerage of the common. This I write to be ſhewed to mr. Fitton whom when I was in Paris, I found vehement in that kind: and told him then as much, as I write now,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60637:9"/>
but feare I moued him not. Lett him conſider that if Ireland be made a ſouerain, both England and Ireland will be ruined temporally, and England by all probability alſo in Religion<hi>:</hi> for both will be engaged in a perpetuall war, and England hardened in hereſy by oppoſition, as we ſee it hath hapned in Holland. But if the King for deſpayr, or neceſſity ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitt to the Parliament and all the forces of Scotland &amp; England fal upon Ireland? If the good of Ireland be to keep England in war, are they Engliſh men, that ſhall ſecond this good of theirs? If I apprehend ryghtly, it is an eaſier matter to ſett England ryght, then to putt the Scors out of Ireland<hi>:</hi> This is to be don by ſieges of as ſtrong places as any be in Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, that by a Feild, or two. England helped brings in Ireland: Ireland ſet vp makes the helping of England more hard. If Religion haue any footing in England, it will be miſtres in Ireland, but it may be miſtres in Ireland, and haue no footing in England. For loue of God be wise, and lett all helpes march together; for if one draw one way, and others other ways, all will be too little. And if all muſt go one way, it muſt be the Queenes way<hi>:</hi> for fittinger it is we ſhould ſubmit, then ſhee. you haue my ſentiment, and I ſhall be glad, if you do not like it at leſt that you ſhould know what conſtructions others make.</p>

            <p>The buſineſſe will be to frame an oath of Allegiance (for this it is which the army requireth of vs) &amp; I beleiue we ſhall do it without aduice from that court, for we haue found by experience ſo little ſucceſſe there in any buſineſſe that tends to the good of Catholick Religion, if it be not ioined with their intereſts there, who proceede vpon princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Policy, &amp; are oftentimes guided by factious perſons, as that we haue little encouragement to hazard the embroyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a buſineſſe of concernement by putting it in to their hands before it be fully finiſhed.

            <p>I am indebt to you for Letters of the 9. &amp; 30. of Aug. &amp; of the 20. 7ber. My ſlow payment hath proceeded from my weekely hopes of obtaining the promiſe of a <hi>Chanonry</hi> for you, (notwithſtanding all your enemys oppoſition) that ſo my Letter myght be the more welcom to you, then whilſt it ſhould carry with it barren expreſſions of my reſpects. And this my neere hopes fluttering ſtill before me hath drawne me into this great arrear<hi>:</hi> for which I humbly aske your pardon. Yeſterday I got the Popes promiſe for you of the chanonry vacant by the death of Monſieur <hi>del Clef,</hi> who dyed 14. 8ber laſt. I had notice of it by Mr. <hi>Fittons</hi> Letter juſt as I was going to my audience<hi>:</hi> &amp; ſo I haſtily ſcribled a note my ſelf, whereby to fix the Popes promiſe ſo as to ground vpon it the ſpeeding of the bulles, without dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of his ſaying afterwards he forgott it &amp; had there-vpon given it a nother. I have alſo ſent for Signior <hi>Zutti</hi> to follow it at the <hi>Datary;</hi> &amp; I haue ſpoken to Dr. <hi>Bacon</hi> to do the like<hi>:</hi> &amp; haue already likewiſe recommended it to Card. <hi>Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poni,</hi> to lend his hand to it, if there ſhould ariſe ſome dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty<hi>:</hi> which truly I doubt not, but in ſuch caſes, in theſe times one cannot be to ſure.</p>

            <p>I haue ſent a letter to the poſt for you. And ſince my doing ſo, I haue receaued that which you haue don me the honour of writing me on thurſday, your 7 of this month. I am infinitely oblidged to you for the frendly care you are pleaſed ſo nobly, and ſo charitably to take of my intereſts. And am aſhamed of the troubles I ſo continually cauſe you. But I ſee your goodneſſe is not to be wearied out.</p>
            <p>I concur with you in all that you ſay in this letter, and profeſſe my ſelf to haue the ſame ſentiments you ſo ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciouſly expreſſ. So that your writing this to one as ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing me to be of a different opinion, and conſequently, your endeavouring to perſvade me hereby (for my good) to be of yours, ſheweth I haue not in my former letters clearly expreſſed my ſelfe<hi>:</hi> And therefore I will make bold to ſay a little now imediatly and directly to what is the ſubiect of this letter of yours. My other letter of this morning ſeemeth vnto me to ſay ſomwhat to this tenor<hi>:</hi> and I think that moſt of my former ones do continualy inculcate the vnhappineſſ of my condition, that to ſaue me and children from ſtaruing, did caſt me vpon courſes and imployments which I forſaw would cauſe exceptions againſt me.

For all theſe things I humbly beg a fauourable conſtruction. And do beſeech thoſe who ſhall looke vpon my life and actions, to conſider the main bulke of them, and the actiue part of them, and what effects haue reſulted out of them; And by
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:60637:50"/>
theſe to judge of my intentions; And according to my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions (which haue euer been ſincere &amp; cordiall to the ſtate) to ground their opinion of me. If in any thing through in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcretion I haue giuen cauſe of miſtaking me, or that through error of Judgment I haue fallen into any error, ſo as offence may haue been taken at it (which I proteſt was euer far from my intention) I do in moſt ſubmiſſiue manner beg in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence &amp; remiſſion, &amp; that it may be gratiouſly paſſed by: And (let me borrow one further expreſſion of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtes doctrine) If I haue, in running through ſo may ſtraights &amp; neceſſities &amp; rockes, committed venial ſin, I craue pardon for it, &amp; that long &amp; heavy Purgatory for ſo many years <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ay be deemed ſufficiently expiatory for it. But as for mortal ſin. I will craue no pardon for ſuch. They admitt none. They muſt proceed from a depraued &amp; averſed minde from the ſtate: ſuch a one, as is not capable of fauour &amp; mercy: And vpon which nothing but death &amp; ruine ought to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. For theſe it is that I ſtandſo peremptorily vpon my juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. And which if I ſhould admitt but a poſſibility of hauing comitted, by craueing fauour for what I may have don in this kinde, I ſhould exclude my ſelfe from all fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; for I ſhould not deſerue the leaſt. But for all other frailties, errors of Judgment, miſtakes &amp; vnhappineſſes that my extreme neceſſities &amp; the natures of my Employments haue caſt vpon me; as I acknowledg my weakneſſ to lay me abundantly open to ſuch beyond my intention; ſo I beg grace &amp; pardon for them. And do humbly beſeech the ſtate, &amp; thoſe it ſhall deſigne to ſift &amp; judge my actions, to looke vpon the effects of them, &amp; to examine if ever any of them were in the leaſt manner prejudicial to it; &amp; accordingly to determine of my intentions: and by them to let me ſtandor fall. This I direct my ſolicitor &amp; Councel &amp; Frendes to offer and craue in my behalfe; whiles in the mean time, they put me vpon my rigourous juſtification for theſe things which properly deſerue the name of crimes. To all which I ſhall

As I doubt not but he will do the like with what elſe I write to him, or that you are pleaſed to let him ſee of my writing to you. I beſeech you joyne my humble thanks with your obliging ones, to that noble genleman, who for your ſake did ſo worthily put by the calumnie which would haue been brought vpon the ſtage againſt me.

Sir K. D. his caſe is not to be conſidered barely vpon the blunt proofes as they lye before the Barons in an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary legall courſe (althô euen in that conſideration, it ſtandeth fair; ſince, puniſhments ought not to be inflicted, but where the crime is evident &amp; vndoubted:) for that were too narrow a compaſſe, for a buſineſſe, &amp; a perſon ſo much looked vpon as this has been. Such as theſe are not only obiects of private Juſtice; but do alſo carry with them the force of publick examples; whereby the minds &amp; appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of multitudes of men are quieted &amp; ſecured, and are encouraged to apply their induſtries to merit of the ſtate; whoſe Juſtice &amp; magnanimity (that hath larger &amp; nobler rules, then do belong to a particular tribunall) is thence rendred conſpicuous &amp; beloued by all men. In this caſe then, (where the actions in controverſy, haue paſſed vpon an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent ſtage) the ſupreme Judges may pleaſe to conſider, 1. the time, &amp; the Perſons behaviour before thoſe actions; 2ly. The circunſtances that he was in, when his behauiour ſeemed doubtful. And laſtly, his carriage euer ſince. The firſt, compriſeth all the time from Sir K. D. his entring into rhe management of publick affairs, &amp; his comportment in them, till his going out of England from Wincheſter houſe, by allowance of the Parliament. During all this time his car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage was ſuch, as made him be looked vpon as one <note n="a." place="margin">Sir K.

and the late King, when all thoſe who were affected to the wayes of the Court embarked themſelues in the intereſts of it. Yet he behaved him ſelfe ſo, that at his going then out of England, when he was allowed the honour of taking leave ſolemnely of the Parliament he received from it the greateſt demonſtration of kindneſs &amp; the moſt obliging civilities, that it euer did to any private perſon; &amp; withall, declared him innocent of all crimes that he ſtood accuſed of againſt the ſtate (for euen then, there wanted not ſome few who were adverſe vnto him) &amp; ordered him the quiet poſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>For the 2.

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ayed by popular Rumers, &amp; took advantage of his abſence ſequeſtred his eſtate<hi>:</hi> ſo that he had not wherewithall to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt abroad; &amp; to maintaine his 3 ſons that he had by him then in France. Herevpon he often petitioned both houſes, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing the diſtreſſed condition he was in, &amp; beſeeching leave to returne and juſtifie him ſelfe of any crime might be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected againſt him, or receive puniſhment in his perſon as well as in his eſtate if he ſhould be found guilty. But the great affairs of the Parliament could never allow the leaſure to take his petition into conſideration. Wherevpon he wrot ſeverall letters to ſome of the eminenteſt Members of both houſes, to acquaint them with the extreme neceſſity &amp; exigents he was in, &amp; with what was propoſed to him to giue him meanes of ſubſiſtance; namely an Employment (the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries whereof, &amp; the reaſons of pitching vpon him, he has informed ſeverall of the Parliament) for France <note n="b." place="margin">He pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends, that he was ſent to Rome by the Queen of France, then Regent. How tru this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence is, let the world judge.</note> (but vnder the Queen of Englands name) to Rome<hi>:</hi> which he
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:60637:52"/>
was very vnwilling to accept of; fearing the miſconſtructions at home that might follow ſuch an Employment. thô he was reſolved and certain that in it he ſhould do nothing in effect that was vnfit for a faithfull ſervant <note n="c." place="margin">He was then reſolued to be very faithfull to the Q. who employed him</note> of the ſtate. Thus, extreme neceſſity, to be able to live himſelfe, and to give his Children bread, forced him (after frequent ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſments thereof at home, to deliver him of it, if it might be) to engage him ſelfe in that Employment which is the only thing that hath begoten any doubt concerning him: Infine, ſuch a neceſſity, as ever by the law of Nature &amp; of Nations, alloweth a man to take by violence, to break open doors, to ſteale food to keep himſelf &amp; children alive when they are ready to ſtarue. And yet the heavieſt accuſation againſt him layeth not to his charge, any particular nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation wherein he may haue deſerved ill of the ſtate (which certainly would haue broken out to light in this long time; if he had acted in any) but only ſuſpitions ariſing from a third perſons letter, written in generall terms, &amp; vpon God knoweth what particular deſignes of his owne; &amp; from the courſe he was in, which he could not avoyde: And which the rather cleareth the candor of his minde towardes the ſtate; ſince in ſuch difficult circumſtances, he behaved himſelfe ſo as nothing riſeth to beare evidence againſt him.</p>
            <p>The laſt &amp; moſt important conſideration of all is how Sir K. D. hath behaved himſelfe euer ſince his leaving to walke in thoſe myſty paths, that afforded ſome ground for ſuſpition. In which it is to be obſerved that as ſoon as he had ſetled a correſpondence betweene France &amp; the Court of Rome to which he was employed, he preſently came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from thence. If thoſe intereſts which are contrary to this ſtates intereſts, had carried him thither; they would ſtill have kept him there, for they dayly preſſed more and more. But as ſoon as a French Ambaſſador was ſettled there, he preſently returned<hi>:</hi> which maketh it cleare that his em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment was but in order to that, &amp; to the conſequences
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:60637:53"/>
thereof. As ſoon as he had giuen an account of his employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the King &amp; Queen of France that ſent him (as they themſelues do witneſs) he continued his former induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries to haue leave to returne home, to juſtifie himſelfe, or vndergo any ſevere puniſhment if he ſhould be found guilty of any objected crime. It was then an active &amp; buſy time with the ſtate of England; which cauſed, that few private buſineſſes could be heard; &amp; among others, his had no anſwer.

            <p>Your letter of the 21. Decem. appeared to haue made a circuit about, for it was of an old date before I received it.

I will tell you an eaſy &amp; familiar remedy for this: of which I have ſeene admirable &amp; ſuddain effects, even in perſons of 20. or 30. yeares deafeneſſe. Make a poſſet drinké with one part of a pretty good ſpirit of wine &amp; two parts of new milke, throwing away the curde. Before you vſe it, droppe a little oyle of ſweete Almends into the deafe eare, &amp; let it ſoake in, for halfe an hour or an hour, laying that eare in a fit poſture for that effect. Then with a ſiringe without a little long pipe at the end; but blunt, ſo as to fill the orifice of the eare, to keepe the liquour from rebounding too eaſily out, inject ſome of the poſſet drinke luke-warme, do this as often as you ſhall ſee cauſe (not aboue twice at a time; but inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting halfe aday between) &amp; always when you have done, ſtop the eare with blacke wool dipped in a little civet, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempered with oyle of ſweete Almonds.

I have ſeen at the firſt ſyringing a hard ſubſtance two Inches long (not vnlike the pith of Elder) ſtart out of the eare.</p>

But for hopes of it, I know not how to meaſure them, being not able to judge of the circumſtances.

            <p>By the laſt mondays poſt I gave your Lordſhip a breife ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of our reſolves, &amp; encloſed in my Letter a copy of the ſubſcription, we had framed, &amp; ſent to our Agent. I could not then enlarge my ſelfe thrrough want of time: now I ſhall endeavour to give your Lordſhip more ample Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in the carriage of that buſineſſe.</p>
            <p>Immediately vpon the receipt of your Lordſhips Letter, I called a conſult, wherein it was reſolved that we ſhould comply with your Lordſhip's deſire in the ſubſcription<hi>:</hi> &amp; the Secretary, &amp; my ſelfe had orders to ſigne &amp; ſeale it in the name of the whole <hi>Chapter.</hi> But before the poſt day came other Chapter men coming to towne, it was thought ſit, that a buſines of ſo great concerne ſhould be debated in a fuller conſult<hi>:</hi> &amp; our proceedings authorized with more numerous votes. In this ſecond Conſult ſuch difficultyes were rayſed <note n="a." place="margin">
                  <hi>By Mr.</hi> Sergeant <hi>who would yeild to no reaſon.</hi>
               </note> againſt that ſubſcription, that in divers ſucceding Conſults they could not be allayed: &amp; ſo we were forced to lay it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, &amp; frame a nother, which we hoped myght give ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It was vrged that the two laſt generall <hi>Chapters</hi> had voted, &amp; ordred that as far as lay in vs, we ſhould not admit of any extraordinary authority, being Commanded ſo to doe by Superiour Powers. We therefore, as being ſubſtituted to the <hi>Chapter,</hi> had not power to act againſt their orders<hi>:</hi> which not withſtanding, we had done, had we ſubſcribed, that we would accept of what his Holynes ſhould impoſe vpon vs. Beſides it was much doubted whether the reſt of our brethren would have approved that ſubſcription, &amp; not have rather hyghly cenſured, &amp; condemned vs for ſuch an attempt: &amp; have ſtood to their former reſolves, &amp; left vs to make good what we had ſubſcribed, which we had obliged our ſelves to

doe.

From hence alſo would follow, that we ſhould be made o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious to all the Catholicks of England, for drawing vppon them ſo great a miſcheife.</p>
            <p>This ſubſcription was judged alſo <note n="e." place="margin">Here is the tru, &amp; ſole reaſon of their diſſent.</note> of dangerous conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to our <hi>Chapter,</hi> &amp; <hi>Government:</hi> for we we are not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, that the court of <hi>Rome,</hi> &amp; the Holy <hi>Congregation de Propagandâ Fide</hi> are deſirous that all Miſſionaryes ſhould have a totall, &amp; immediate dependence on them. How then can we be ſecured, that if wee make that ſubſcription, by which we give vp our own liberty, his Holines will not take vs at our word, &amp; reduce vs to immediate ſubjection, inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent of any other, but himſelf, by annulling our <hi>Chapter,</hi> or impoſing vpon vs a <hi>Vicarius Apoſtolicus.</hi> Tis tru we doe not ſo much fear the later, becauſe your Lordſhip hath engaged your promiſe to oppoſe it, &amp; the very conſtitution of our nation is like to exclude it<hi>:</hi> but for the former, we have
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:60637:71"/>
much reaſon to ſuſpect it will come to paſſe, when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how vnſuitable <note n="f." place="margin">Marke this.</note> this <hi>Chapter</hi> is to the inclinations of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> how oppoſed by Mr. <hi>Leybourne</hi> (who as we are informed was the firſt author of this <hi>Subſcription</hi> out of a deſigne to ruin it) &amp; other moſt potent &amp; active adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries: &amp; how we cannot be confident even of your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips Patronage, being you have given vs no promiſſe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the rights of the Chapter; but only to oppoſe extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary authority.

                  <hi>Here we have Dr. VVaring's acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vnder his hand, that the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the</hi> Chapter <hi>is illegal, &amp; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Canons.</hi>

            <p>Laſtly we conſidered that the Court of Rome could never in reason <note n="k." place="margin">
                  <hi>This is a cenſure of thoſe who required the ſubſcription, as demanding a thing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable, &amp; of the</hi> Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>it ſelf, which at the firſt Conſult appròved of it.

               </note> expect ſuch a ſubſcription from us, ſince it was never heard, or read of, that any Eccleſiaſticall body ever of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferd vp the like. And indeed it could only ſuite with thoſe, who after ſome great ſchiſme, or diſobedience to his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, were now become very penitent, &amp; ſenſible of their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, &amp; by ſuch a ſubſcription would give an outward teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of it. In vs, who were never guilty of any ſuch crime, it would be eſteemed only a fraudulent mask for ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne, eſpecially ſeing we have ſo lately made it knowne to his Holines, &amp; the court of Rome by Mr. <hi>Lois</hi> his meanes that our Reſolutions were quite oppoſite to this ſubſcription.</p>
            <p>For theſe motives, my Lord which wee co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceive very rationall, &amp; convincing, we thought fit to wave that ſubſcription, &amp; ſo to offer another which myght nether argu vs imprudent nor convince vs to be fraudulent; but yet myght ſatisfy the juſt, &amp; rationall expectation of his Holines: the copy of which I have here ſent your Lordſhip.
